*Google Cast's Remote Display Sample for Android*


This sample shows how to use the new Google Cast feature called Remote Display. Your sender app can now render directly to any Cast receiver, like a Chromecast. 
The remote display on the receiver can present information that is entirely different than the information presented in the display on the sender device.
