*Google Cast's Remote Display Sample for Android*


This sample shows how to use the new Google Cast feature called Remote Display. Your sender app can now render directly to any Cast receiver, like a Chromecast. 
The remote display on the receiver can present information that is entirely different than the information presented in the display on the sender device.

NOTE: To make it run you would need an Application Id that you have to get after signing in to the [Google Cast SDK Developer Console](https://cast.google.com/publish)


Abstract
--------

At [*Adevinta*](http://www.adevinta.com) we try to find new ways to engage users and facilitate the way they share their content, so we thought that it would be cool to allow user to share the ads that they found via Tv or other screen. This makes that couples, friends and family could discuss if they like or not these products without needing to pass their devices to each-other in a simple way. To make this possible we thought that Cast-enabled devices like [*Google Chromecast*](http://www.google.com/chromecast) would be a good choice and that's why we implemented Google Cast into our Android application. Currently, we only cast our ad detail pages, showing images full screen and the title of ad and the price.
